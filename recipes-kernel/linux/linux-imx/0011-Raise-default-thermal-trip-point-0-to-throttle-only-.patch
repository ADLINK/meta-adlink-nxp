Subject: [PATCH 11/47] Raise default thermal trip point 0 to throttle only at
 95 C.
MIME-Version: 1.0

Freescale currently configures the following thermal defaults:
- At 85°C CPU temp (trip point 0) the 3D GPU clock is throttled to 1/64 and
  CPU clock to 1/2 of normal speed.
- Once the CPU cools by 10°C both clocks go back to normal.
- If the CPU reaches 85 + 20 = 105°C (trip point 1) the system shuts down.
  This '+ 20' default is now hardcoded, whereas older 3.10 kernels had
  #defined a dedicated constant set to 100°C.

However at 85°C ambient(!) the CPU temp will unavoidably be higher than
that, and our climate chamber tests even run at 90°C ambient to have a
safety margin. Therefore we raise default trip point 0: now the i.MX6 will
throttle only at 95°C (and switch back to normal at 85°C).

But this also would raise the default shutdown temp to 115°C, which is
unacceptable. An old (also 3.10) comment by Freescale stated 105°C is the
maximum allowed silicon temp. Therefore we re-introduce the dedicated
constant, including the old comment, and set it to 103°C. This is lower
than Freescale's current limit, but higher than their old one.

Note these are only defaults; the trip points can be adjusted at run time
simply by writing new values (in millicelsius) to
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/trip_point_*_temp.

Freescale also added a check preventing users from raising trip point 0
higher than the default (was 85, now 95°C). But this seems too restrictive,
after all root should know what they're doing. Changed code to allow up to
default shutdown temp (now 103°C).
