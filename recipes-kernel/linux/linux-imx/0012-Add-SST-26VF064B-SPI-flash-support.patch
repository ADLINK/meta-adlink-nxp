Subject: [PATCH 12/12] Add SST 26VF064B SPI flash support

SST's 26VF* series is largely compatible to the 25VF* chips so simply add a
table entry with name, ID and parameters.

The 26VFs feature a new quad bit mode; set the appropriate feature flag even
though the i.MX6 doesn't even support the older dual mode yet (for which we
also set the flag for the 25VF064C while we're at it).

Unfortunately the 26VFs also use a completely new, incompatible block
protection scheme, which Linux's spi-nor driver doesn't know yet. But for
now we rely on U-Boot having unlocked everything before booting, so writing
works fine. The production version LEC-iMX6 will switch back to the SST
25VF064C, anyway.
